# client/Dockerfile — SvelteKit client (@sveltejs/adapter-node)
#
# This file lives in client/, but the build context MUST be the repo root so
# the npm workspaces resolve. docker-compose.yml (and Coolify) build with:
#   context: .          # repo root — required for the npm workspace layout
#   dockerfile: client/Dockerfile
#
# Notes / assumptions:
#   - The client imports @farminggame/shared as TypeScript source (workspace
#     `main`/`exports` -> `src/index.ts`), so shared/ must be present at build
#     and runtime (vite + the adapter-node output resolve it via node_modules).
#   - adapter-node emits client/build/; the runtime runs `node build` with the
#     prod deps present. We copy the full root node_modules (which contains the
#     client's prod `dependencies` that SvelteKit externalises) — correct, if
#     slightly larger than a `--omit=dev` prune.
#   - ORIGIN / WS_URL / secrets are supplied by docker-compose at runtime.
#   - Base image node:22-alpine (npm 10) avoids the npm >= 12 EALLOWGIT issue
#     with the lockfile's git dependency (uWebSockets.js).
